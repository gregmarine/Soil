/**
 * The proofread spell checker: the English frequency dictionary bundled in this extension's APK
 * (`assets/proofread/en_82765.dict`, attribution in the `NOTICE.txt` beside it) with SymSpellKt
 * behind it for correction candidates. The `.dict` file holds gzipped `term frequency` lines; the
 * extension is opaque on purpose, because AAPT decompresses a `.gz` asset at build time and strips
 * the extension from the APK.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin/JVM by design: the dictionary arrives as an [InputStream], so JVM tests read the
 * exact asset the extension ships (the test source set mounts `src/main/assets` as resources) and
 * the editor hands in `assets.open(...)`. Nothing here touches Android — and nothing here logs;
 * document text never reaches a log on either side of the extension seam.
 *
 * **Loading is two-stage, because checking and suggesting have wildly different costs.** [isKnown]
 * needs only the word→frequency map — one pass over the file, fast everywhere. The SymSpell delete
 * index behind [suggestions] is ~30 derived entries per word, and building it measured **tens of
 * seconds on a Supernote's CPU** (under a second on a desktop JVM — the gap is the device). Flags
 * must not wait on that: [load] builds the map and the engine can check immediately;
 * [loadSuggestionIndex] feeds *the same map* into SymSpell afterwards — the asset is never read
 * twice, so the index can never diverge from the words — and until it lands [suggestions] honestly
 * returns nothing while [suggestionsReady] is false, which the popup says out loud instead of
 * pretending there are no candidates.
 *
 * The map keeps frequencies, not just membership: suggestion ranking is frequency-ordered, so a
 * `Set` of known words would silently reorder every candidate list.
 *
 * The dictionary indexes lowercase terms, so knowledge is case-insensitive and casing is this
 * class's job: [suggestions] re-shapes each candidate to the shape of the word being corrected
 * ("Teh" → "The"). [shouldCheck] is the conservative gate — it refuses to judge anything the
 * English dictionary cannot honestly judge (digits, acronyms, mixed case, non-ASCII letters);
 * silence over noise, per the proofread design.
