/**
 * The incremental-recheck arithmetic behind the editor's proofread pass — which part of the
 * document an edit dirties, and which words in it deserve a flag.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin like the rest of this package: the editor feeds it plain text and change offsets, so
 * every decision here is pinned by JVM tests rather than found on a device.
 *
 * The pass is *regional* for the screen's sake, not the checker's: lookups are microseconds, but
 * every span added or removed is an e-ink repaint. So an edit re-checks only its own lines — a word
 * never crosses a newline, which makes line bounds safe word bounds — while the tokenizer still
 * reads the whole text, so fence and link context stays right no matter how small the region is.
