/**
 * The format bar's overflow: what does not fit on the bar moves into a panel below it.
 *
 * The two properties that make it worth having are both about *not* losing the tools:
 *
 * - **Views are MOVED, never cloned.** A tool in the panel is the same object that was on the bar,
 *   so its click listener, its long-press hint and its content description come with it and cannot
 *   drift out of step with the copy on the bar.
 * - **The panel is in flow, below the bar.** It pushes the text down instead of floating over it —
 *   on e-ink an overlay leaves a ghost of itself, and a writer who opened a menu should still be
 *   able to see the line they are writing.
 *
 * The full palette is twenty-one tools plus five separators; a Nomad cannot show it whole. A bar that
 * scrolled would hide its tail with no sign that there is one, so the tail moves — and it always
 * moves to the same place, so what stays on the bar stays put for a given screen and muscle memory
 * still holds.
 *
 * Two things a caller must honour, both of which the arithmetic depends on: every moveable child
 * needs an **exact px** width in its `LayoutParams` (`WRAP_CONTENT` measures as 0 here), and group
 * separators must be plain [View] instances — that is how [isDivider] tells a separator from a tool.
