/**
 * Where the floating [SelectionToolbar] and its level sub-toolbar go — pure arithmetic, JVM-tested
 * (Paper's `ToolbarAnchor` semantics). Every value is px in the notebook root's coordinate space.
 *
 * The bar sits [place]'s [gap] below the selection box, horizontally centred on it. When that would
 * push it past [bandBottom] (the bottom strip's top edge) it flips to [gap] *above* the box instead
 * — the user's hand is below the selection when they finish a lasso, so below-then-flip is the
 * order that keeps the bar out from under it. Either way the result is clamped inside
 * `[0, rootWidth]` × `[bandTop, bandBottom]` (the top bar's bottom edge to the bottom strip's top):
 * a selection drawn against a screen edge still gets a fully reachable bar, and the bar never lands
 * under chrome, where its own taps would be eaten.
 *
 * The **sub-toolbar hangs off the bar** ([placeSub]) — below it, or above it when the bar itself
 * flipped (and the other way round when that would leave the band), centred on the bar, clamped the
 * same way — so opening it never moves the bar the user just aimed at, and the two rows never
 * overlap chrome or each other.
 *
 * There is no dependency on Android here on purpose — the geometry is the part worth testing, and
 * the view work ([SelectionToolbar]) is the part that cannot be.
