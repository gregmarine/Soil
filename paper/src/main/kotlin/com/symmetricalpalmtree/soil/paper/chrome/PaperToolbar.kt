/**
 * Back plus the tool buttons of a paper-hosting screen (arc 11 / J1) — three, or two where the
 * screen has no lasso ([btnLasso] is nullable since arc 43 / K2) — **binding-free**: it
 * takes the views themselves rather than a generated binding, which is the whole reason the
 * notebook's own [NotebookToolbar] could not simply move here — that one is hard-bound to
 * `ActivityNotebookBinding` and carries the notebook's clipboard-loaded icon swap and lasso re-tap.
 * This is the spartan version the Scratch Pad extension wants: arm a tool, keep the buttons honest.
 *
 * Two rules, the same two [NotebookToolbar] documents:
 *  - **Release the render first — but pen-gated.** While the EPD writing overlay is armed the bar
 *    will not show a new pressed state and the tap reads as broken. The gate is
 *    [PaperView.releaseRender]'s own contract: an ungated release inside the pen-active window can
 *    cost a live stroke.
 *  - **[sync] is the truth, not our taps.** g-paper changes tools by itself (smart lasso arms
 *    LASSO and restores PEN when the selection goes), so button state is driven from
 *    `PaperListener.onToolChanged` — never assumed from the tap that started it.
 *
 * **The eraser has two kinds** since arc 29 / LE2: a second tap on the armed eraser is not the P1
 * no-op any more but [onEraserReTap], which opens the shared [EraserBar] — Point · Lasso. Nothing
 * is remembered: a plain tap from another tool always arms [Tool.ERASER], and the lasso eraser is
 * reached only through that re-tap.
 *
 * **The pen may have two kinds too** since arc 44 / T3 — the sketch face's graphite pencil and its
 * gel pen ([btnAltPen]). They are **both [Tool.PEN]** to g-paper: nothing about the tool differs,
 * only the style, width and colour the engine is armed with, and those belong to the screen, which
 * is why this bar asks it ([altPenArmed]) rather than deciding. So a pencil↔pen tap is an *actual*
 * change with no tool change in it — [onToolTapped] fires, the screen applies the kind
 * ([onPenKindPicked]) and [sync] repaints — and a tap on the already-armed pen of **either kind**
 * is [onPenReTap] with that kind, the eraser's re-tap rule in every particular (see [select]). Every parameter is
 * defaulted and last, so a screen with one pen compiles and behaves exactly as it did.
 *
 * Selected = the bordered `state_selected` look of `bg_toolbar_button`. No colour anywhere.
