/**
 * The family's one **fuzzy name match** — pure Kotlin, no Android, JVM-tested.
 *
 * Two screens ask the same question of a name ("could the user have meant this?") and they must
 * never answer it differently: the library's search shelf, and the template browser's (the template browser,
 * which searched with SQL `LIKE` until this file replaced it). A `LIKE` cannot be fuzzy, so
 * matching moved out of the database entirely and into here — every candidate's name is read
 * blob-free and ranked in memory, which for a library of names is nothing.
 *
 * **Fuzzy means subsequence, not typo tolerance** (the user's explicit arc-20 call): the query's
 * letters must appear in the name **in order**, gaps allowed. So `mtg` finds "Meeting Notes" and
 * `blg` finds "Blog 20251008" — while `bolg` finds nothing, because a swapped letter is not a
 * subsequence. Edit distance was offered and declined; adding it needs a fresh decision, not an
 * afternoon's judgement. (Where that line actually falls is worth knowing: a **dropped** letter
 * still finds its name, since "these letters, in order, some missing" is what a subsequence is.
 * A **wrong or swapped** one does not.)
 *
 * Ranking is a [Match]: the **tier** first (how literally the name contains the query), then how
 * many of the matched letters landed on a **word start**, then how **tight** the run is. Ties
 * below that are broken by the caller-visible rules in [rank] — shorter name, then the name
 * itself — so the same library always produces the same page of results.
