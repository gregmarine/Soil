/**
 * The stroke-level edits a paper-owning extension can put back (arc 11 / J4–J5 as the pad's
 * `ScratchAction`; the four stroke kinds shared as `:ext-ink` since arc 23 / Y1). An edit is a
 * stroke, a set of strokes, a translation, or ink that arrived from the notebook — every one names
 * the page it happened on, so a history that spans pages (the pad's page list, the calendar's
 * periods) can navigate there before replaying.
 *
 * The history itself is `:sn-screen`'s `UndoRedoStack`, typed by each consumer on its own action
 * type (the pad wraps these under a `ScratchAction` alongside its page-level `Page` action, which
 * stays in the pad — the calendar has no page list to edit). The replay of these four is
 * [InkDocument.revert] / [InkDocument.reapply]: in memory, on the page the document is showing, with
 * the consumer flushing afterwards — the same "the store is the source of truth" rule the notebook
 * replays under.
