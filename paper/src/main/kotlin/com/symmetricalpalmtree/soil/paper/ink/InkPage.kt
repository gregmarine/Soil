/**
 * What [InkScreenActivity] needs of the page a paper-owning extension is showing (arc 23) — the
 * *ink* half of a consumer's document and nothing else. Everything structural around it stays the
 * consumer's own: the pad's page list and its inserts and deletes, the calendar's periods, its
 * bookmark and its navigation.
 *
 * The two mutations that answer a g-paper callback are synchronous and run on Main (they touch only
 * the in-memory page, so a pen-up never waits on IO); [flushUntilClean] is `suspend` and hops to IO
 * for the store call. The screen serialises the suspending half behind its page-op lock.
