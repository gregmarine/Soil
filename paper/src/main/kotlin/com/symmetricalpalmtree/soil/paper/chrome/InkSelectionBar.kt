/**
 * The floating selection bar an **ink-on-paper extension screen** puts next to a lasso selection
 * (arc 11 / J4 as the pad's own, the calendar's copy at arc 23 / Y1, **one class here** since the
 * arc-23 sweep): **Send to Notebook** when a notebook is behind us, **Delete** last.
 *
 * The shape is the shared decision, and it is why this is not simply a [FloatingSelectionBar] call
 * at each consumer: Move is the drag itself and neither screen has headings, links, clipboard or
 * snap, so the notebook's seven buttons come down to the one that always applied plus the one that
 * pays for the hop — **Send first, Delete last**, the notebook's order, with the one destructive
 * verb on the far edge. Both release the render before their row runs: the tap has to show its
 * result, and the delete repaints the page underneath.
 *
 * Send is **absent, never disabled**, when there is no notebook behind us — a greyed control is
 * invisible on e-ink. That is what a null [sendHint] means; the hint itself is the consumer's own
 * wording, which is all that ever differed between the two copies.
