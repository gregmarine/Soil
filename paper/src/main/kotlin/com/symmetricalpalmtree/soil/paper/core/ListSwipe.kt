/**
 * The one-finger flip for every **paginated list**: the library and folder-picker card
 * grids, the link picker, the template browser, and the Contents / Recents panels. The pager
 * buttons stay exactly as they are; this is the same page turn, made with the hand.
 *
 * It is [SwipeMath]'s rule applied to a region instead of the whole screen, so the gesture the
 * notebook already teaches — drag left for the next page, right for the one before, about a third
 * of the way across — means the same thing on a list. A swipe at either end is a **no-op**, never a
 * bounce and never a wrap: the host's own `goToPage` clamps, exactly as a tap on a disabled-looking
 * pager button already does.
 *
 * **Observer only**, like `PageGestures`: it is fed from the host's `dispatchTouchEvent` and
 * consumes nothing, so cards keep their taps and long-presses and the chrome keeps its buttons. A
 * card cannot mistake a swipe for a tap anyway — the finger is long past the touch slop before this
 * fires, which cancels the click on the way.
 *
 * **Armed by region.** The sequence counts only if its DOWN landed inside [region] — the grid
 * container or the list body, never the bars. That is what lets the template browser live inside
 * New Notebook without a drag across the name field turning the page, and it is why the width in
 * the distance rule is the region's, not the screen's: in the sidebar form of the Contents panel
 * the list is 60 % of the glass, and a swipe should be measured against the paper it is on.
 *
 * **Finger only.** A stylus sequence is dropped whole (the user's call): the pen writes, the hand
 * navigates, and that is the same division `PageGestures` draws on the page itself.
 *
 * **Optionally vertical too.** A host that gives [onSwipeDown] / [onSwipeUp] gets the flip's rule
 * rotated 90° ([SwipeMath.vertical], judged against the region's *height*) — the Bible reader's
 * swipe-down for its index, the same travel the notebook teaches for its Contents. The two
 * evaluations are exclusive by dominance, so one drag is a flip or a vertical swipe, never both;
 * a host that leaves them null keeps the horizontal-only detector every list has always had.
 *
 * **Optionally two-fingered too.** A host that gives [onTwoFingerSwipeDown] gets the notebook's
 * Recents gesture (`PageGestures`' two-finger vertical rule): a second finger landing on a
 * one-finger drag that has **not** yet qualified starts a two-finger sequence measured at the
 * two-finger centroid, judged by [SwipeMath.vertical] when the sequence drops back to one finger
 * (or a third finger lands on a qualifying one), and only the **down** direction is claimed. A
 * second finger landing on an already-qualifying one-finger swipe is still the late arrival it
 * always was — the flip commits and the rest of the sequence is stood down. A host that leaves it
 * null keeps the one-finger detector exactly as it was.
 *
 * **Optionally a tap too** (the Bible reader's cross-references). A host that gives
 * [onTap] hears of a one-finger, finger, in-region sequence that ended without qualifying as
 * anything and never moved past the touch slop — with the UP's position in the **region's own
 * coordinates**. It rides the same sequence the swipe judges, so a drag that turns the page can
 * never also be a tap, and a second finger kills it the way it kills the flip. A tap on nothing
 * is the host's to ignore; this class decides only that a tap happened.
