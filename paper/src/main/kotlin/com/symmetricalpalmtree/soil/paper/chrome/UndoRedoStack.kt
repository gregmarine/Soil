/**
 * A paper-hosting screen's in-memory undo/redo history, over whatever action type [A] that screen
 * records (arc 11 / J1: genericised and moved to `:sn-screen`, so the notebook and the Scratch Pad
 * share the ordering rules without sharing an action set — the notebook's 14 kinds live in
 * `NotebookUndo.Action` in `:app`). g-paper keeps no history by design
 * (`host-responsibilities.md`) — the host records what happened and replays it — so this is the
 * record.
 *
 * **Screen-level, not page-level:** the notebook's actions each carry the page they happened on, so
 * history survives a page turn (an insert or a delete *is* a page turn, and undoing one has to
 * reverse that turn too). The stack is cleared only when the screen dies — never on a flip.
 * Recording a fresh edit clears the redo side. Bounded at [MAX] entries, oldest dropped: an erase
 * or a delete holds the full geometry of every stroke it must be able to put back.
 *
 * **And bounded again by bytes, for a screen whose entries are not ids** (arc 43 / K2, ported from
 * Paintsprout's raster sketchbook). Every screen up to now records *references* — stroke ids, page
 * ids, rows that are still in the file and merely stamped — so a hundred entries cost nothing worth
 * counting, and the default [cost] of zero and budget of [Long.MAX_VALUE] leave those screens
 * exactly as they were. A **raster** page has no rows to un-stamp: the only record of what was
 * there before a mark or a rub is the pixels that were there, and a page-wide erase's before-image
 * is the size of the page. So the undo side also keeps a running [undoBytes] and evicts while it is
 * over [budgetBytes] — and what it evicts is always the **oldest entry that actually costs
 * something**, never a free one, because dropping an id-only edit would shorten one screen's
 * history to pay for another's, which is a bill the wrong hand receives.
 *
 * Pure ordering only. Applying an action back onto the paper and the store lives in the host
 * screen, where the paper, the session and the store are all in reach — and where the SN rule holds
 * that a replay mutates the store first and then reloads the page, because the `.soil` is the
 * source of truth.
 *
 * @param cost how many bytes an entry holds — zero for every id-carrying screen, the tiles' size
 *   for a raster one. Read once per entry, at the moment it enters or leaves a side.
 * @param budgetBytes how many bytes the undo side may hold. A constructor parameter for one reason
 *   only: the eviction rule is arithmetic and deserves to be proved on a laptop, and proving it at
 *   the real number would mean allocating the real number per assertion.
