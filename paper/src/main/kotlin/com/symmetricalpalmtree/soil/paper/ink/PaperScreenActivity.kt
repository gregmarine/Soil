/**
 * The **chrome and handoff half** of a paper screen — everything a screen with a g-paper surface
 * needs that knows nothing about *what is on the paper*.
 *
 * [InkScreenActivity] is a screen whose page is **strokes in a row store**: it owns a page-op
 * lock, an ink document, an undo stack of stroke edits and a lasso selection. A **raster** screen
 * shares none of that and all of *this*: the two thin bars, the chrome toggle and its collapsed
 * corner button, the eraser sub-bar, the free band, the stylus-vs-finger dispatch, the pen-idle
 * gate, the problem dialog, and above all **the EPD handoff**, which is the part no screen may get
 * wrong twice.
 *
 * So the split is by *what the code knows*, not by subject: nothing here mentions a page, a stroke,
 * a store or a selection, and [InkScreenActivity] extends it with every one of those intact.
 *
 * **The EPD handoff order is g-paper's law.** A caller that owns a g-paper surface releases
 * (`releaseForHandoff()`) immediately before launching us, we reclaim in [onResume]
 * (`resumeDrawing`), and **every** exit goes through [finishWithHandoff] — `releaseForHandoff()`
 * and then `finish()`. A failure there is fixed in g-paper, never worked around here.
 *
 * The subclass assigns [paper], [chrome], [gestures] and [eraserBar] in its `onCreate`.
 *
 * **Frame silence:** no app frame while `paper.isPenActive`. Chrome text goes through
 * [PenIdle.whenIdle] ([whenPenIdle]); the frames that do not are recorded exceptions.
