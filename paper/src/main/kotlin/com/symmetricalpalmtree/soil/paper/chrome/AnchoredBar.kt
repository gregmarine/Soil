/**
 * A small bordered bar of icon buttons hung **under a top-bar button** (arc 21 / W2) — the shape
 * [LassoPopup] minted in arc 8 and the tag button's secondary toolbar needed a second time.
 *
 * It exists as one class rather than two because the second one would have been a copy: the same
 * placement call, the same measure-before-place rule, the same rects, the same button recipe. That
 * is the `RattaNotebookView` sibling-copy trap in miniature, and the app's answer to it is always
 * to put the shared logic in one place and let the callers say only what differs — which here is
 * the buttons and when the bar is allowed to open.
 *
 * Buttons are **icon-only with long-press hints**, the recipe every chrome button in SN follows,
 * at [R.dimen.toolbar_button_size] so they grow with the tablet tier. [bar]'s own orientation is
 * the caller's layout: a horizontal one takes buttons ([addButton]), and a **vertical** one takes
 * rows the caller builds ([addRow], arc 44 / T3 — the sketch face's [PencilBar]).
 *
 * What the caller still owns: *when* it opens and closes (a tool switch, a page swap, a finger
 * gesture, an outside tap), and unioning [rects] into the exclusion rects and the `overChrome`
 * test — a pen landing on a floating bar must never ink, and a finger tapping one must not read
 * as a page gesture.
 *
 * Moved from `:app` into `:sn-screen` in arc 29 / LE2 so the eraser sub-bar ([EraserBar]) can be
 * shared by all four paper surfaces rather than copied into each one.
