/**
 * One page of ink, in memory, with the op log that gets it to the store (arc 11 / J4 as the heart
 * of the pad's `ScratchDocument`, on rows since arc 22 / X2; shared as `:ext-ink` since arc 23 /
 * Y1). A consumer's document owns *which* page is showing and everything structural around it —
 * the pad's page list, the calendar's period rows — and delegates *what is on the page* here.
 *
 * **The split of threads is deliberate.** Mutations ([addStroke], [erase], [move], the replays) are
 * synchronous and run on Main, straight out of the g-paper callbacks: they touch only the in-memory
 * page, so a pen-up never waits on IO. [flushUntilClean] is `suspend` and hands the statements to
 * the consumer's `exec`, which hops to IO for the store call. The consumer serialises the
 * suspending half behind one mutex, exactly as the notebook serialises its page ops.
 *
 * **The page is a `TreeMap` keyed on the stroke's `"order"`.** That column is the writing order and
 * it is load-bearing: recognition and every render read ink as a sequence, and an erase that came
 * back at the end rather than in place would change the page. Orders are unique per page and
 * monotone — a new stroke takes the next order — so a restore can put a stroke back at the order it
 * held and nothing can have taken it. "Monotone" is a **high-water mark** ([highWater]), not the
 * last key in the map: erasing the tail stroke lowers the last key, and a new stroke that reused
 * its order would collide with the erased one when an undo brought it back.
 *
 * **What is unwritten is an op log, not a dirty flag.** Each edit records one entry per stroke id —
 * a `Put` (the row as it should now read) or a `Drop` — in a [LinkedHashMap], so a second edit to
 * the same stroke coalesces onto the first and a flush is one statement per touched stroke rather
 * than a re-encode of the page. The SQL for the two is the consumer's ([StrokeSql]), so each table
 * keeps its own pinned strings.
 *
 * **Re-flush until clean.** [flushUntilClean] snapshots the log and clears it *before* the IO hop,
 * then loops while it has been re-dirtied: a stroke committed during a write would otherwise be in
 * a snapshot that was already sent. A failed flush merges its snapshot back **under** anything
 * newer and rethrows. A consumer with something of its own to write (the pad's page size, the
 * calendar's first-stroke rows) says so through `extraDirty` and prepends it inside `exec`.
