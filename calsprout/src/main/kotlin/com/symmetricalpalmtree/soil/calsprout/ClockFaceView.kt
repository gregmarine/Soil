/**
 * The dial — twelve numbers on a ring, one of them inverted, and a tap that names
 * one. Every angle, every offset and every hit test is [ClockFaceModel]'s: this class owns paints,
 * pixels and one touch listener, and computes nothing it could ask for.
 *
 * **Why a face and not two steppers.** A time on a calendar page is a place, not a count, and a
 * person reaching for "half past two" with a pen knows where that is on a clock before they know how
 * many taps it is from nine. Two taps get you any time on the grain the picker offers.
 *
 * **Nothing here moves.** No hand, no sweep, no ripple, no animation — the picked number is drawn
 * inverted (paper on ink) and that is the whole feedback, because on e-ink an animation is a smear
 * and a highlight that is only a tint is not visible at all.
