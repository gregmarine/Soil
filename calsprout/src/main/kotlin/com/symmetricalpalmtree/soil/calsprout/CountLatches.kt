/**
 * The seven buttons of `view_count_latches.xml`, wired — the one control the repeat
 * interval, the "after N times" count and the reminder's amount all share, so a count is asked for
 * the same way in all three places. Which latch is down and what More says are [CountPresets]'; this
 * class is views and listeners only.
 *
 * **It reports, it does not remember.** A preset tap and a keypad Done both come out of [onValue],
 * and the caller writes them into whatever it holds and calls [render] back with the answer — the
 * same "one road" every other control on these dialogs takes. The value kept here is only what the
 * keypad needs to open on.
 *
 * @param row the `<include>`d latch row.
 * @param titleRes what the keypad calls the number it is asking for ("Every", "After", "Remind me").
 * @param range the field's own range — the keypad's typing width and its clamp.
