/**
 * The calendar's page — in memory, over [CalendarStore]. The screen owns the paper and the
 * chrome; this owns *which* page is showing (a [CalendarTarget]), whether its rows exist yet, and
 * its size; **what is on the page** — the strokes, the op log, the re-flush rule and the four
 * stroke-level replays — is `:paper`'s [InkDocument], shared with the Scratch Pad so the two
 * never drift.
 *
 * **Rows are minted on the first stroke, never on open.** [show] reads what is there and writes
 * nothing but the bookmark; a page with no row is shown blank at the surface's size with ids
 * minted in memory. The flush that carries the page's first `Put` leads with the two
 * `INSERT OR IGNORE`s ([CalendarStore.mintRows]) — a flush that is nothing but `DELETE`s (a stroke
 * drawn and undone before the debounce) mints nothing, because there is nothing to keep. A page
 * that exists at `0 × 0` (a paste minted it before any screen saw it) learns the surface's size
 * the way the pad's does: one `UPDATE`, ahead of the strokes, put back if that write fails.
 *
 * [show] reads the target page **first** and flushes the departing one **second**, so the swap
 * itself has no suspension point for a commit to fall into (the pad's rule). Every page shown is
 * remembered by its id, so an undo action recorded on another page can navigate back to it.
 *
 * **The split of threads is deliberate.** Mutations ([addStroke], [erase], [move]) are synchronous
 * and run on Main, straight out of the g-paper callbacks; everything that reaches the store is
 * `suspend` and hops to [Dispatchers.IO] for the store call itself. The screen serialises the
 * suspending half behind one mutex.
