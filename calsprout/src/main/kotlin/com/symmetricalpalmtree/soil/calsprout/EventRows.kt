/**
 * One `event` row (and its three child sets) → one [Event] — pure, JVM-tested.
 *
 * **`StrokeRows`' rule, applied to a wider row: a bad row is a dropped event, never a lost day.**
 * The store counts what it dropped and logs the count; nothing throws, because a single unreadable
 * row must not take the day's other events with it. What counts as unreadable:
 *
 * - an enum name this build does not know (a type, a freq, a monthly mode, an end mode, a reminder
 *   unit). The original Notesprout folded an unknown type to "Event"; relabelling a row this code did not write is a
 *   lie about data, so the row is dropped instead;
 * - a date that is not ISO `yyyy-MM-dd`, or an `endDate` before its `startDate` — the span is the
 *   one invariant every query depends on;
 * - **`recurring` disagreeing with `freq IS NOT NULL`.** The column is a stored mirror kept so the
 *   expansion read is an index hit, which means a row where the two differ is invisible to exactly
 *   one of the two reads — the mirror is load-bearing, so a broken one is a broken row.
 *
 * A NULL `freq` means no recurrence, and the weekdays and exceptions handed in are then ignored:
 * a one-off has none by construction, and honouring stray child rows would resurrect a rule the
 * event no longer has.
