/**
 * What the events screen's band holds, and how much of it fits — pure and
 * JVM-tested, because this is the part that gets an off-by-one and the part a screenshot cannot
 * check.
 *
 * The pager idiom is `TagPaging`'s, and every reason carries over: **rows are measured against the
 * real band**, never a guessed count, so the list never half-draws a row and never leaves a gap;
 * the arrows **never disable** (a disabled control is invisible on e-ink), they simply have nothing
 * to do at the ends; and with one page the pager is `INVISIBLE`, not `GONE`, so the band keeps its
 * height and the rows above it do not shift when the count crosses the boundary.
 *
 * The one thing that is *not* the tag list: rows here are not all the same height. A section header
 * is shorter than an event row, so a page cannot be `total / perPage` — it is a greedy walk that
 * adds heights until the next row would not fit. Two sections, two heights, one arithmetic.
