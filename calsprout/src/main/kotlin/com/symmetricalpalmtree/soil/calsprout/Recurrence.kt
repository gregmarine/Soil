/**
 * The recurrence engine — pure, `LocalDate` throughout, Notesprout SN's, with its one
 * deliberate divergence from the original Notesprout (below). It answers three questions and enumerates:
 * does this event cover this day, which occurrence covers it, and when is the next one.
 *
 * **Every occurrence keeps the anchor's span length**: an occurrence beginning on `O` covers
 * `[O, O + spanDays]` inclusive. That is what makes a three-day vacation repeat as a three-day
 * vacation rather than as three separate days.
 *
 * **Exceptions are passed in**, not read off the rule ([Event.exceptions] is its own table here).
 * An excluded start contributes no coverage on any day of its span — deleting "this occurrence" of
 * a multi-day event removes the whole occurrence, not the day that was tapped.
 *
 * **Cost.** NEVER / UNTIL rules test only the candidate starts in `[day − spanDays, day]`, so a
 * birthday anchored decades ago is O(spanDays) — effectively O(1). COUNT rules enumerate the first
 * N starts (N is user-small, capped at 999) and test coverage directly, because "the 5th
 * occurrence" cannot be decided from a date alone.
 *
 * ## The one divergence from the original Notesprout: weeks start on Sunday
 *
 * The original Notesprout counts WEEKLY interval weeks from **ISO Mondays**. This calendar's weeks start on **Sunday**
 * everywhere else — the grid's columns, the week page's date, [CalendarDates.weekStart] — and a
 * repeat rule that disagreed with the grid it is drawn on would be a bug the person could see. So
 * the week index here is counted from Sundays, and a listed ISO weekday `d` sits `d % 7` days after
 * its week's Sunday. Pinned by `RecurrenceTest` so no reviewer "fixes" it.
