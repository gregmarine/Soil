/**
 * "Remind me when?" — everything behind the editor's Remind glance button (arc 24 / Z2, the user's
 * design), in [TimePickerDialog]'s shape: a live preview over the controls that set it, and every
 * word it shows is [EventWording]'s so the dialog and the glance button cannot disagree.
 *
 * **One reminder** (the user's call). The editor therefore offers an amount and a unit, not a list:
 * Save replaces whatever the event held, and **None** clears it. [EventRules.REMINDERS_MAX] stays —
 * it is the store's rule, and an event written before this screen existed may still carry three;
 * saving from here is what reduces it to one.
 *
 * The amount is the shared [CountLatches] row — six presets and a keypad past
 * them, the same control the repeat dialog's two counts use.
 *
 * **It applies on Save and discards on Cancel**: the amount and the unit are local `var`s until the
 * positive button hands a new draft back, which is what makes every latch free to be tapped at.
