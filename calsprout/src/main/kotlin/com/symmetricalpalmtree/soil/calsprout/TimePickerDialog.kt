/**
 * "What time?" — the editor's start/end time dialog (arc 24 / Z2; the face is Z5b), in
 * [DayPickerDialog]'s shape: the extension's own, built on the layout, and every rule it applies is
 * [TimeMath]'s or [ClockFaceModel]'s and JVM-tested. This file is views and listeners only.
 *
 * **A clock, and two taps.** Pick the hour on the dial and the face turns to minutes by itself; pick
 * the minute and you are done. That one automatic step is the whole reason it is two taps rather
 * than three, and the hour/minute latches above the dial are the way back from it — tapping either
 * shows that face again, so a wrong hour is one tap from being right.
 *
 * The minute face is on [TimeMath.MINUTE_STEP]'s grain, which is the same call the steppers this
 * replaced made: five minutes is what a calendar entry is worth, and a sixty-position dial is one
 * nobody lands on with a pen.
 *
 * OK and Cancel are the AlertDialog's own buttons: Cancel writes nothing at all, which is what makes
 * the whole face free to be tapped at.
