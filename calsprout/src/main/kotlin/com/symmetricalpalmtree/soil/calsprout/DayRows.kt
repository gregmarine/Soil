/**
 * Which half-hour row of a Day page each of its marks lands in — **pure**,
 * JVM-tested, no `android.graphics`.
 *
 * The Day page's geometry does **not** change for events (the locked decision): the rows are the
 * rows, the ink already on them does not move, and an event is a right-aligned label inside a row
 * it shares with whatever is written there. So the whole question is *which row*, and that is this:
 *
 * - an **all-day** mark has no time, so it takes a row from the **top** of the half — one per row,
 *   in the order given, on **both** halves (an all-day event is on the afternoon too);
 * - a **timeless** mark (`allDay == false` with no `startMinute` — the shape `EventRules` permits
 *   and `EventOrder.DAY` sorts last) has no row of its own either, so it takes an all-day row;
 * - a **timed** mark sits at the 30-minute row its start minute falls in, and only on the half
 *   whose window holds that minute;
 * - a row can hold both, and then it counts them ("2 events"): the page has one line per row and
 *   the person opens the events screen for the rest.
 *
 * Marks past the last row are **dropped** — there is nowhere to show them, and a label drawn under
 * the closing hairline would be a lie about which half-hour it belongs to.
