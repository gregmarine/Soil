/**
 * Where the organizer is looking, and what every navigation does to it — pure,
 * JVM-tested, so the screen is a thin caller: it asks for a [Move], shows it, and tells this it
 * landed.
 *
 * **The anchor is the point of this class.** A calendar page is a *period*, but a person is looking
 * at a *day*, and the three views are three magnifications of that one day. So the state carries an
 * [anchor] day alongside the showing page: toggling Month → Week → Day walks down to the same day
 * rather than to three unrelated first-of-periods.
 *
 * The anchor moves in exactly four ways:
 *
 * - **Open or step** — it is derived from the page ([arriving]): a Day page anchors on its day; a
 *   Month or Week page that **contains today** anchors on *today*, so the first toggle out of this
 *   month lands on this week and out of this week on today; any other period anchors on its own
 *   first day.
 * - **Pick, Today, double-tap** — it is the day the user named.
 * - **Toggle** — it does not move at all. A toggle is a change of magnification, not of place; this
 *   is what lets Week → Day come back to the day (and the half) you left.
 *
 * [anchorHalf] travels with the anchor and is only ever the half *that anchor day* is looking at: a
 * Day page sets it to its own half, and any move to a **new** anchor day resets it — to the clock's
 * half when that day is today (a Day page opened from this morning opens on the morning), otherwise
 * to AM. A toggle to Day then simply uses it, which is why "Week → Day" after "Day Sep 3 PM" is
 * Sep 3 PM again.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the store, the paper or the clock: [today] and the hour are passed in, so a
 * test can put the calendar on any day of any year.
