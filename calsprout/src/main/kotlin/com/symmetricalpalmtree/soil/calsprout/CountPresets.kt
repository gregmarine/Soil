/**
 * The small-number row — six presets and a way out. Pure; [CountLatches] is the seven
 * buttons that read it.
 *
 * **Why six and a "More".** Every count this row answers — every N days, after N times, N days
 * before — is 1 to 6 almost every time it is anything at all, and a stepper made those common
 * answers cost up to six taps each. Seven latches make them cost one, and the seventh admits that
 * the range does not end at six: it opens a keypad ([KeypadModel]) for the rare answer, and then
 * *shows* that answer, so a value of 30 is never hidden behind a word.
 *
 * **Exactly one latch is always down.** A row with nothing down reads as broken on e-ink, so a value
 * below the range's floor is treated as 1 rather than left un-answered — the same call [LatchGroup]
 * makes for the Ends row.
