/**
 * The **Upcoming** look-ahead — pure, Notesprout SN's.
 *
 * A reminder here is a paper-like heads-up, **not a notification**: an event carrying a reminder of
 * lead `L` surfaces on every day `D` where `O − L ≤ D < O`, `O` being the start of its next
 * occurrence. So the section answers "what is coming" without anything ever ringing, which is the
 * whole reason this app has reminders at all.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating, because each is a question someone will ask of a blank section:
 *
 * - **an event with no reminders never appears here.** Nothing is late and nothing is missed — the
 *   day's own list is where an event with no lead time lives;
 * - **an occurrence today is not upcoming**, it is today. `daysUntil` is always ≥ 1;
 * - **one row per event**, its soonest qualifying occurrence — a daily standup with a two-day lead
 *   is one line, not two.
 *
 * The caller reads the rows; this function only decides. `oneOffs` are the store's non-recurring
 * rows starting in `(day, day + `[MAX_LOOKAHEAD_DAYS]`]` (re-checked here, because a pure function
 * that trusts its caller's `WHERE` clause is a pure function with a hidden precondition), and
 * `recurring` is the whole recurring set with its children.
