/**
 * One event, on a whole screen — new or existing. Notesprout SN's editor, Greg's own design.
 *
 * **Not exported.** Like [EventsActivity] it is launched only in this process, by the events
 * screen, so there is no caller check to make.
 *
 * **The shape is three rows over the note area.** The title with the type beside it; the dates, the All day toggle
 * and the times; then two **glance** buttons. A glance button says the word alone when the thing
 * is unset ("Repeat", "Remind me") and the value concisely when it is set ("Every 2 weeks",
 * "1 week before"); the details live in [RepeatDialog] and [RemindDialog], which apply on their
 * own Save and discard on Cancel.
 *
 * **Delete is not here** — an event's one destructive verb is a per-row trash icon on the events
 * list. The top bar is `[Cancel] … title … [Save]`; Cancel and system Back are the same door.
 *
 * **The state is an [EventDraft], not an [Event].** Every field rule is a pure function over that
 * draft and is JVM-tested. This class turns taps into those calls and the draft into views.
 *
 * **The recurring prefill, and the anchor behind it.** Opening an occurrence of a series shows
 * *that occurrence's* dates, so "this occurrence" means the one that was tapped. But the series'
 * real anchor is older, and saving the prefill back unchanged must not silently re-anchor it.
 * [EventWrites.editSeries] keeps the stored anchor when the dates come back untouched, so this
 * screen prefills with **exactly** those two dates and hands [EventStore.edit] the **stored**
 * original.
 *
 * ## The note
 *
 * Two halves behind one toggle — [NoteSurface]'s bounded paper and `inputNote` — and **both
 * contents are always kept**: the latch chooses what is shown, and Save writes the ink and the
 * text whichever of them was on the glass. [NoteKind.defaultFor] decides where a showing starts.
 *
 * [applyKind] is the whole showing rule and every change routes through it, because there are two
 * inputs to it and only one of them is a tap: the kind, and whether the keyboard is up. The paper
 * cannot be written on under the IME (the layout shrinks, the page does not — see [NoteSurface]),
 * so `blocked` is the *or* of "the Text half is showing" and "the keyboard is up", and a
 * Handwriting-latch tap with the IME up therefore sets the kind now and shows the surface when the
 * keyboard goes down. **Nothing here ever hides the IME**; the person uses the keyboard's own key.
 *
 * **Save reads the note on Main, before the IO hop.** The pen keeps writing while the store call
 * runs, and the page is Main-thread state — so both possible [NoteWrite]s are built here and the
 * store is handed a lookup ([EventStore.edit] is what decides which id the fields land under).
 *
 * IME rules (Ratta): the keyboard is asked for with the **explicit** flag 0, from
 * [onWindowFocusChanged] behind a once-per-showing latch for a NEW event's title, and directly
 * from the Text latch's tap, which is a user act on a window that already has focus. It is
 * **never hidden**: on Supernote hiding the IME kills hardware key delivery too.
