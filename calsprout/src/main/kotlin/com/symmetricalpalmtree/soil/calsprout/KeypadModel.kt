/**
 * What the keypad has been typed so far — a digit string and the number it means.
 * Pure; [KeypadDialog] is the grid that calls it.
 *
 * **A string, not an Int.** "0" and "" are different states on a keypad and the same number, and the
 * difference is what tells the preview whether to show the value the person arrived with or the one
 * they are typing. So the model starts **empty**, [value] is null until a digit lands, and the
 * dialog shows [current] in the meantime.
 *
 * Two rules keep the string honest, and they are here rather than in the listener because both are
 * silently wrong on a device and obvious in a test:
 * - a leading zero is **replaced** by the next digit, never built on — "05" is not a number anybody
 *   typed on purpose;
 * - a digit that would make the string longer than the range's own longest number is **refused**.
 *   Refusing is what a clamp cannot do: 999 typed into a 1..99 field would otherwise land as 99 and
 *   look like the keypad had eaten a digit.
 *
 * [value] still coerces into [range] on the way out, for the one case the width rule cannot catch —
 * a two-digit number below a two-digit floor, or above a cap like 99 in a 1..50 field.
