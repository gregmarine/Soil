/**
 * One calendar **event** and the small types it is made of — immutable, pure,
 * `java.time` only. Notesprout SN's model, which differs from the original Notesprout's in two ways:
 *
 * - **there is no JSON.** the original kept the rule, the reminders and the exception list in a `data` column;
 *   here every field is a row column and the three sets are their own tables .
 *   So [RecurrenceRule] does **not** carry the exception dates — they belong to the event, not to
 *   the rule, because that is the table they live in;
 * - **an event carries a note** — a page of handwriting (`note_stroke` rows, whose page size is
 *   [Event.noteWidth] × [Event.noteHeight]) and a text note ([Event.noteText]), the two behind one
 *   toggle in the editor. Neither is the original's.
 *
 * Dates are [LocalDate] everywhere in Kotlin; ISO text exists only at the row
 * (`CalendarDates.format` / `CalendarDates.parse`). Minutes are minute-of-day integers, so no
 * formatter and no time zone is ever involved: an event is a thing on a calendar page, not an
 * instant.
