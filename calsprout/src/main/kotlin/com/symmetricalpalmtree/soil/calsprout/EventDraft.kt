/**
 * The event editor's state, as a value — every field the screen edits, flat, and
 * every field *rule* as a pure function that answers a new draft.
 *
 * **Why the editor does not edit an [Event].** An [Event]'s recurrence is a nullable object; the
 * editor's is six controls that stay on screen while the repeat is off, remembering what they said.
 * A draft is therefore flat where the event is nested, and the nesting is rebuilt once, in
 * [toEvent], through [EventRules.normalize] — the same normalization the store runs. So what the
 * screen shows and what the row will hold cannot drift: there is one conversion and it is tested.
 *
 * **Every rule here is a function, not an `if` in a click listener.** Choosing a start date after
 * the end date, turning all-day on, switching to weekly with no weekday chosen — each is a small
 * decision about what the *other* fields should now say, and each is the kind of decision that is
 * silently wrong on a device and obvious in a test.
 *
 * The carried-over fields ([id], [exceptions], [createdAt]) are not edited by any control at all;
 * they ride through so [toEvent] can rebuild a whole event without the screen holding the original
 * alongside. The note's three ([noteText], [noteWidth], [noteHeight]) rode through the same way
 * until Z3 gave them [withNoteText] and [withNoteSize] — which is why that phase added two
 * one-line copies rather than three fields.
 *
 * [repeatTouched] is bookkeeping, not content: it records whether the person has said anything
 * about the repeat yet, which is the only thing that decides whether choosing a *type* is allowed
 * to offer that type's usual recurrence. [changedFrom] ignores it for exactly that reason.
