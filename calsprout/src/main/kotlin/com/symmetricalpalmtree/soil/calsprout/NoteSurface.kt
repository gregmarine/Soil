/**
 * The event note's handwriting half: one page of ink on a **bounded** g-paper surface
 * under the editor's fields. Notesprout SN's.
 *
 * **What it is not.** Not an `InkScreenActivity`: the editor is a form with a paper *view* in it,
 * not a paper screen with chrome over it. So this class owns what the skeleton would have — the
 * paper, the [InkDocument] over [NoteSql], the in-memory undo, the finger gestures and the lasso's
 * one-button bar — and leaves out what the skeleton exists for: there is **no debounce and no
 * leave flush**. The note is kept in memory until the event's Save, where [write] hands its
 * statements to the store to ride the event's own transaction; Cancel discards ink exactly as it
 * discards a typed title.
 *
 * **The page size is minted, not measured twice.** A note that already has a size (`event.noteWidth
 * × noteHeight`, written with its first stroke) keeps it wherever it is shown, anchored top-left,
 * 1:1 — the pad's rule. A note without one takes the area's size at its **first** layout, and holds
 * it: the keyboard shrinks the view under `adjustResize`, never the page. [mintedSize] is what Save
 * writes — the page's size once there is ink, and the stored size (possibly none) while there is not.
 * The page carries one template — the "Notes" band label at the page's top-left,
 * baked at the page's own size and rebaked only when that size changes.
 *
 * **Blocked is how the surface goes away.** While the keyboard is up, or the Text half is showing,
 * the view is `INVISIBLE` **and** the whole of it is an exclusion rect: an attached Ratta paper view
 * keeps the firmware pen claimed whatever its visibility, and the firmware paints wherever it is
 * not told not to — a hidden view without the block would still ink under the keyboard. Before the
 * page is on the paper the same block stands, so nothing can be written that a load would then
 * throw away.
 *
 * **The EPD handoff**: the calendar behind the events list touches
 * nothing (its view tears down on focus loss, the engine's process-local ownership guard does the
 * rest); this surface reclaims in the editor's `onResume` ([resume]), releases before **every**
 * `finish()` ([handoff]) and is torn down in `onDestroy` ([release]). A failure there goes to
 * g-paper, never a host workaround.
 *
 * Frame silence: the bar's show at lasso completion (and its re-anchor after a move) is the
 * ledgered exception, as on every paper screen.
