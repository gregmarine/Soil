/**
 * What the **grid** knows about an event — the four things a Month cell's glyph row
 * and a Day page's row label need, and nothing else.
 *
 * A [DayMark] is deliberately **neutral of the store**: no id, no recurrence, no reminders, no note.
 * The grid is baked into the page's template bitmap, which is redrawn whenever the bake key changes
 * ([CalendarActivity]'s `BakeKey`), and that key compares marks **structurally** — so a mark must
 * carry exactly what is drawn and nothing that merely moves underneath it. An occurrence of a
 * recurring event and a one-off that read the same on the page *are* the same mark, and neither
 * causes a repaint the person could not have seen.
 *
 * Note two shapes the day list already allows and the grid has to answer for:
 * `EventRules.normalize` clears [startMinute] whenever [allDay] is set, and a **non**-all-day event
 * may still have no start minute at all (a "timeless" event) — [DayRows] gives both of them a row
 * from the top of the half rather than a row on the clock.
