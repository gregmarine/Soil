 * Where a Month or Week cell's glyphs sit — **pure**, JVM-tested, no

 * [CalendarGeometry] already owns every rect the painter and the hit-test share: the arithmetic
 * that decides whether a third type fits is testable, and the Canvas code is only ink.
 *
 * The placement rule: the glyph row is
 * **right-aligned** on the day-number row, because the number is left-aligned and the two must
 * never meet; slots are as tall as the number, between 10 and 16 dp; and when there is not room for
 * every distinct type the last slot becomes a `+`, which says "and more" without lying about which.
