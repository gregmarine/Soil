/**
 * Every statement the events half of the calendar sends, as a pure builder — SQL text and bound
 * arguments and nothing else, so every shape is JVM-testable without a store and pinned by
 * `EventSqlTest` through the seam's own checker. Notesprout SN's, with one column more: **every
 * event names its calendar**, and every read of the event table is for one calendar.
 *
 * Three rules the text carries:
 *
 * - **`event` is never `INSERT OR REPLACE`d.** REPLACE deletes the conflicting row first, and
 *   with `foreign_keys` ON that delete CASCADES — it would take the event's weekdays, its
 *   exceptions, its reminders and its whole handwritten note with it. The upsert is
 *   [insertEvent] + [updateEvent], **in that order**: two idempotent statements whose retry
 *   converges;
 * - **child rows are a set, rewritten wholesale** — `DELETE … WHERE eventId = ?` then
 *   `INSERT OR IGNORE`, in the same batch as the event row and after it, so the foreign key
 *   always has its parent;
 * - **no read carries an `IN (…)` list.** The bind limit is 999 arguments, and a day with a
 *   thousand events must not read differently from a day with three. A day's one-offs come by
 *   span overlap; the recurring set comes by its indexed flag; both sets' children come by a
 *   JOIN carrying the parent read's own predicate.
 *
 * Enum values are bound as their `name`, dates as ISO text ([CalendarDates.format] — which
 * orders correctly as text, so `startDate <= ?` is a real range scan), booleans as 0/1, and
 * `now` is a parameter rather than a clock read so a test can pin it.
