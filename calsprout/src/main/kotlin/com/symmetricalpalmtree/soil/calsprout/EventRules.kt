/**
 * What an [Event] is allowed to be — pure, pinned, and the same answer on every
 * screen. Two halves, deliberately separated:
 *
 * - [normalize] fixes everything that **can** be fixed without asking: caps, whitespace, a set the
 *   rule's own mode says is meaningless, an end before a start. It is total — it never refuses;
 * - [problem] names what normalization cannot fix, so the editor can say why Save did nothing.
 *
 * The store runs both on the way in, whatever the editor already did: a row that occurs on no day
 * is invisible to every query, which is a worse answer than a refusal.
 *
 * The title takes the **tag rule** for whitespace the codec would otherwise have to escape — tabs
 * and newlines are **dropped**, not turned into spaces. A pasted two-line title becomes one word
 * boundary short rather than one row tall, and a row's text stays a row's text.
