/**
 * The clock face's arithmetic — where each number sits on the dial, and which number
 * a tap landed on. Pure, so [ClockFaceView] is a canvas and a touch listener and nothing else.
 *
 * **Twelve positions, always.** Both faces have exactly twelve, which is what makes one set of
 * angles serve both: the hours are 12, 1 … 11 and the minutes are 0, 5 … 55 at
 * [TimeMath.MINUTE_STEP] apart. Five minutes is the grain a calendar entry is worth (the same call
 * the old stepper made), and a sixty-position dial is a dial nobody lands on with a pen.
 *
 * **The dead centre picks nothing.** A tap has to be out on the ring to mean a number: near the
 * middle every position is equally close, so the honest answer is null rather than whichever one the
 * angle happened to round to. The same goes for a tap well outside the dial — the dialog's own
 * padding is not part of the clock.
 *
 * Angles run **clockwise from 12 o'clock**, which is the one convention a clock has; the geometry is
 * therefore `sin` on x and `-cos` on y, not the mathematical `cos`/`sin` pair, and [hit] inverts
 * exactly that with `atan2(dx, -dy)`.
