/**
 * The time picker's arithmetic — pure, so the dialog is a thin caller: it reads the
 * three parts out, lets the face and the latches change them, and hands over one minute of day.
 *
 * **A minute of day is the only stored form.** There is no `LocalTime`, no formatter and no time
 * zone anywhere in events: an event is a thing on a calendar page, not an instant, and 9:00 AM is
 * 9:00 AM on whatever device opens the notebook. The 12-hour split lives here and only here.
 *
 * **Three independent parts, and no arithmetic between them.** The hour, the minute and the half are
 * dialled separately — the person is naming a place on a calendar page, not counting elapsed time —
 * so nothing here can walk a value off the end of the day. Arc 24 / Z5b replaced the two steppers
 * with a clock face ([ClockFaceModel]); what stayed is this, the time truth: [snap] and
 * [minuteOfHour] are what put a stored minute on the face's grain, and [minuteOfDay] is what takes
 * the three parts back.
