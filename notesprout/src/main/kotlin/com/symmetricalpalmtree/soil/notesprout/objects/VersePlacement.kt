/**
 * Where the verses of a passage land on a page — pure, JVM-tested.
 *
 * **The column** (Greg's decision in SN): the left edge sits [LEFT_FRACTION] of the way across
 * the page and the text wraps at the page's right edge, because a text object's width is
 * re-derived as `pageWidth − x` on every load (position is authored, size is derived — a centred
 * 80 % column could not survive a reload). So the only free coordinate is `y`, and this object
 * chooses it: the first clear spot scanning outward from a preferred `y` in [STEP_DP] steps,
 * with [GAP_DP] of air ([FreePlacement]'s numbers). **No clear spot is no spot** — unlike
 * [FreePlacement], which falls back to the centre for a small object, a block of verses dropped
 * on top of what is there is unreadable twice over (the Nomad walk stacked one on another), so a
 * page with no room, like a box taller than the page, is the caller's "no room" refusal — the
 * page-fit rule the user asked for.
