 * headings, footnote callers) describes a whole chapter's typesetting, and half a chapter of it
 * read out of the middle would open on a hanging poetry indent or a heading belonging to verses
 * that are not here. So the passage view flows the `verse` table's clean plain text instead — the
 * reader's own **paragraph** — and marks structure only where the reference itself changes
 * subject: a MAJOR heading naming the book and chapter at every crossing, the shape Biblesprout's
 * passage view had.
 *
 * **Never logged**: what these atoms carry is scripture, and where they come from is a reference.
