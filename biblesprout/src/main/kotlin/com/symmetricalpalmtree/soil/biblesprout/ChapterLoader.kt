 * tappable spans; the page's own are on its [reader.HeadingAtom]s.

/**
 * Everything the reader's screen needs off the main thread, in one place: the
 * installed source, the typography, the canon's chapter counts — and a small cache of built
 * chapters, so a flow across a chapter edge is usually one `invalidate()` rather than a read, a
 * pagination and a dozen `StaticLayout`s.
 *
 * **Every method here blocks — call them on `Dispatchers.IO`, never Main.** [close] is the one
 * exception; it is called from `onDestroy` and only takes the cheap field lock.
 *
 * Two monitors, deliberately:
 * - [lock] guards the fields and the cache. Only ever held around field work — never around the
 *   first-run asset copy or a database open, which Main must never end up waiting on.
 * - [buildLock] serializes chapter building. One [ReaderTypography] means one shared `TextPaint`,
 *   and a `Paint` measured from two threads at once is not safe. The cost is that a foreground
 *   load can wait for one already-running prefetch build; the prefetch is what makes the edge
 *   free in the first place, and the screen is showing its "Loading…" line meanwhile.
 *
 * **Nothing about what is read is ever logged** — this class holds scripture and says nothing.
