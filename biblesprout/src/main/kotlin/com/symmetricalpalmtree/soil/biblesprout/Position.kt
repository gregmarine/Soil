/**
 * Where the reader was left: book, chapter, and the verse the page in
 * front of the user opened on. Written on every committed turn, read on the next open — and it is
 * the whole of what the extension stores, one row in the host's `state` table.
 *
 * The wire form is deliberately boring and human-readable: `GEN:1:1`. [decode] is **total** — a
 * value from a store this build did not write (a hand-edited row, an older shape, a truncated
 * write) yields `null`, and the reader falls back to [GENESIS_1] rather than refusing to open. A
 * lost bookmark is never an error the user has to answer.
 *
 * Pure — no Android, no store. It is never logged: the position names where the user has read.
