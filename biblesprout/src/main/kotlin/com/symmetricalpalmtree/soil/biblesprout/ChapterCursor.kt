/**
 * The canon as a single chain of chapters — what turns a swipe past the last page of
 * Genesis 50 into Exodus 1, and a swipe back off Exodus 1 into Genesis 50's **last** page
 * (decision 10). Pure: no Android, no database, no view — it is handed the source's own chapter
 * counts (`BibleDatabase.books()`, read once) and orders them by [Canon]'s ordinal, so the chain is
 * the canon's and never the map's iteration order.
 *
 * A book the map does not mention is **skipped**, not guessed at: a source that ships part of the
 * canon still reads end to end. [next] of the last chapter of the last present book and [prev] of
 * the first chapter of the first are `null` — the reader's silent no-op at Revelation 22 and
 * Genesis 1.
