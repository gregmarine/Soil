/**
 * The verses of a small passage as the Markdown a notebook text object holds (an earlier arc "Verses")
 * — the pure half of `IBible.passageText`, JVM-tested over fake [VerseRow]s with no database.
 *
 * The user's shape (2026-09-13): a **bold label line** — the canonical form the reference
 * resolves to (`**John 3:16–18**`) — then the verses as prose with **plain verse numbers**
 * (`16 For God so loved…`), one paragraph per chapter run, exactly where [PassageAtoms] puts a
 * heading: a passage read across a chapter edge changes paragraph there, and a passage across
 * books says so with a second label line of its own.
 *
 * The cap is the user's rule — "only small references; full chapters are too big" — and the
 * reader enforces it, because only the reader knows how many verses a wire names:
 * [MAX_VERSES] verses in all, and **no whole-chapter range at all**, however short the chapter.
 * The host adds its own page-fit check on top; this one is about what may be asked for.
 *
 * **Never logged**: what this builds is scripture, and where it comes from is a reference.
