 * it must be materialised first.)
 *
 * **The one thing Biblesprout writes to disk itself**: re-derivable APK content, never user
 * data, which lives in Soil's app store. It lands in [Context.getNoBackupFilesDir], not
 * `filesDir`, so the platform's backup agent never ships 15 MB of public-domain scripture
 * anywhere, and an uninstall takes it with the package.
 *
 * Blocking: call it on `Dispatchers.IO`. Notesprout SN's, verbatim: the copy is crash-safe
 * (`.part` → fsync → rename, and the stamp written last).
