/**
 * What the index panel shows, with no views in it — pure and
 * JVM-tested, so the list a finger taps is proved by a test rather than by squinting at a device.
 *
 * **The notebook's Contents, with a grid for the second level.** Every book is a root entry; an
 * *expanded* book is followed by its chapters as rows of [CHAPTER_COLUMNS] numbers — a number
 * needs a square, not a line of its own, and a grid is what the old two-grid dialog taught the
 * hand already (B3). The whole thing is **one flat list of uniform-height rows** ([items]) so
 * that the panel paginates it the way the Contents paginates headings: rows per page measured
 * once from the real body height, a page turned by the pager or a swipe. Psalms' 25 rows of
 * chapters simply run on across pages like any long outline would.
 *
 * Nothing here knows which page is showing or which book is open — that is the panel's
 * in-memory state, handed in as [expanded]; this object only answers what the list looks like
 * and where a given book or chapter falls in it.
