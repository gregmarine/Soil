 * Ported from Biblesprout (`reader/Atom.kt`). The word-layer fields came out with
 * the features that used them — this reader has no word popup and no highlights —
 * and the heading's `minor` boolean grew into [HeadingKind], because the four
 * heading kinds render differently (decision 8: psalm superscriptions italic,
 * parallel-passage lines small italic). The heading's cross-reference links came
 * back at an earlier arc, when the parallel-passage lines became tappable.
