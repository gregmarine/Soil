/**
 * Find, replace, and counting for the document editor's find bar and its word count.
 *
 * Plain functions over plain strings, like everything else in this module: no view, no state, no
 * android — so the offset arithmetic is JVM-tested and behaves the same wherever it is called.
 *
 * Matching is case-insensitive and non-overlapping — each match begins after the previous one
 * ends. Overlapping hits would make "next" walk one character at a time through a run of repeats,
 * which is not what a find bar is for.
