/**
 * The narrow view of a mutable text store that [MarkdownFormatter] edits through.
 *
 * The formatter is where every caret off-by-one in the document editor lives, so it must be
 * testable without a device. Four members are all it needs, and none of them mention
 * `android.text` — which is what lets the whole of [MarkdownFormatter] run under plain JUnit
 * with no Robolectric and no instrumentation.
 *
 * Indices are character offsets, half-open (`start` inclusive, `end` exclusive), exactly as an
 * `Editable` treats them.
