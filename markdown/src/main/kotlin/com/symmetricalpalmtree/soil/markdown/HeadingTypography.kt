 * The heading type spec — one place, so a heading measured by the store, drawn on the page, and
 * previewed in a dialog can never disagree about its size.
 *
 * Headings render on **one line, END-ellipsized** (`MarkdownDraw.measure(singleLine = true)`): a
 * heading is a title, and a title that wrapped would push the ink below it out of place every time
 * the text grew. [PADDING_DP] is the breathing room around that line inside the object's bounds.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin — no android imports — so it is JVM-testable and callable from any thread.
