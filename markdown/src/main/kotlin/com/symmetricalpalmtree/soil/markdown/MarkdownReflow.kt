/**
 * Rejoins hand-wrapped lines into paragraphs.
 *
 * Handwriting recognition returns one line for every line that was written, which is the only
 * honest thing it can do — it saw ruled paper, not sentences. What comes back is prose broken at
 * every wrap. Reflow repairs that: a single break inside a block becomes a space, while the blank
 * lines the recognizer emits at real paragraph gaps stay the breaks they always were.
 *
 * It is deliberately timid. A break is only removed where it is *certainly* a wrap, because a
 * wrongly removed break destroys structure the writer put there, whereas a wrongly kept one is
 * just a break they can delete:
 *
 * - **Blank lines** separate paragraphs and survive; a run of them collapses to the one break it
 *   meant.
 * - **Headings** and **rules** stand alone — nothing joins onto them and they absorb nothing.
 * - **Table rows** (a line opening with `|`) stand alone too: their columns are positional, so
 *   joining one to the next would scramble the table.
 * - **List items** and **blockquotes** each start their own line but *do* absorb a following plain
 *   line, which is exactly the wrapped-item case.
 * - **Code** ([MarkdownCode]: a fence and what it holds, an indented block after a blank line)
 *   passes through byte for byte, blank lines included — inside code a break is content, not
 *   layout.
 * - **Indented lines** (four spaces or a tab) stand alone anywhere, so an indented line is never
 *   joined even where it is not code.
 * - A **hard break** — two or more trailing spaces, Markdown's explicit line break — is honoured,
 *   and the two spaces are written back out. Trimming them would silently delete the very thing
 *   this rule exists to protect.
 *
 * Leading whitespace is dropped everywhere it is not structure (an indented block, or the up-to-
 * three spaces that nest a list item). Recognition hands back a leading space on most lines, and
 * once the breaks around it are gone that space shows up as a dent at the start of a paragraph.
 *
 * The result is trimmed at the end and the function is idempotent: reflowing settled text returns
 * it unchanged, which is what lets a caller compare input to output and report "nothing to join".
