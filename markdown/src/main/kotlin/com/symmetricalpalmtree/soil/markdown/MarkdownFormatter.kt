 * Every edit the document editor's format bar (and its keyboard shortcuts) performs.

 * The editor's model is always the raw Markdown source, so a button press writes exactly the

 * bold and the buffer gains two `**`, which is indistinguishable afterwards from a `**` typed at
 * the keyboard. That is what keeps one code path serving the plain source and the rendered view.
 *
 * Every operation returns the [Selection] to install afterwards. The caret is not left wherever
 * the splice happened to put it — it is placed where writing continues, which for a wrap is
 * around the same words as before, and for a skeleton insertion is on the placeholder about to be
 * overtyped.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin: it edits through [TextBuffer], never `android.text`.
