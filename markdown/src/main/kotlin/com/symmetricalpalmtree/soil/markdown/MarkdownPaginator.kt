/**
 * Splits a laid-out document into page-height slices **on line boundaries** — the piece the PDF
 * preview export stands on: each slice becomes one rendered page, and no line of text is ever cut
 * through by a page edge.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin by design. A layout engine cannot run on the JVM, so the caller measures first and
 * hands over one [Line] per laid-out line (from `StaticLayout.getLineTop(i)` /
 * `getLineTop(i + 1)`); everything decided here — where each page starts, which lines it holds —
 * is plain math over those boxes, covered by plain JVM tests. The caller draws a page by
 * translating its canvas up by [Page.top] and clipping to the page height.
 *
 * The rules:
 *
 * - **A line belongs to exactly one page.** A line whose bottom would cross the page edge starts
 *   the next page instead of straddling both.
 * - **Every page starts flush at its first line's top.** Whatever gap the layout put above that
 *   line (a block gap, a blank line) stays on the page before, so page two never opens with a
 *   dent of dead space that only existed to separate it from page one.
 * - **A line taller than a whole page gets a page to itself** and is clipped at the bottom when
 *   drawn. Refusing it would make pagination fail on a document that renders fine, and splitting
 *   it would cut text — clipping one freak line is the honest degrade, and it guarantees the
 *   walk always advances.
 * - **No lines, no pages.** An empty layout paginates to nothing; whether that means "nothing to
 *   export" is the caller's call, made where it can say so to the user.
