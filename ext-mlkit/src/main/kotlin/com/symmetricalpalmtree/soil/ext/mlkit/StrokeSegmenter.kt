/**
 * Pure geometry: a flat list of a page's [InkStroke]s → reading-order lines and paragraphs. No ML,
 * no Android types, single column; unit-testable on its own.
 *
 * **Lines come from a vertical projection profile, not from sorting.** Sorting strokes by their
 * vertical centre and greedily merging interleaves strokes from adjacent lines the moment a
 * descender on one line dips past an ascender on the next, which fragments sentences that would
 * otherwise recognize cleanly. Instead a coverage histogram over Y finds the dense *bands* of
 * writing separated by whitespace, and each stroke joins the band its centre falls in (the nearest
 * band when it falls in a gap). That is robust to ascenders/descenders and to tight line spacing.
 *
 * The constants below are the values the recognition pipeline has been tuned to on real e-ink
 * handwriting — treat a change to any of them as a behaviour change, not a tweak.
