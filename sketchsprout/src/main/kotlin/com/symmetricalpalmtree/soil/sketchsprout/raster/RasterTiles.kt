/**
 * A square of a raster page's before-image, and where on the page it belongs (Notesprout SN's, ported
 * from Paintsprout, where the design was proved).
 *
 * [pixels] is row-major ARGB, [width] to a row, exactly what `Bitmap.getPixels` writes and what
 * g-paper's `RasterPatch` takes back — so the array crosses into the engine as it stands, with no
 * format in between and no copy. The rect is carried as four numbers rather than as an
 * `android.graphics.Rect` so that everything about an undo entry except the swap itself can be
 * proved on a laptop with no tablet in the room.
 *
 * The array is **not** a snapshot the engine may keep: `swapPageRaster(layer, …)` writes that
 * raster's old pixels back into it, which is the whole trick that lets one entry serve undo and
 * redo. So nothing else may hold a second reference to it and read it later expecting the
 * before-image to still be there. A tile carries no layer of its own, which is why the entry does:
 * pixels read off one raster can only ever be swapped back into that one.

/**
 * The grid an undo entry's before-image is kept on, and the builder that fills one in.
 *
 * ## Why a grid, and not the rectangles the engine reported
 *
 * g-paper reports a raster change once per batch, and an eraser sweep is dozens of batches a second
 * whose rectangles overlap heavily along the line the hand is travelling. Storing a tile per batch
 * — the obvious reading of "keep the before-image" — would let a minute of slow scrubbing pile up
 * tens of megabytes of near-identical pixels *inside a single entry*, and blow the stack's budget
 * from the inside, where evicting old entries cannot help.
 *
 * So the page is divided once, into [CELL]-pixel squares aligned to its own top-left corner, and
 * the first time a contact touches a cell that cell is read; every later batch that crosses it
 * reads nothing. Three things follow, and all three are the reason:
 *
 * - **An entry is bounded by the page.** The Nomad's page is 1404 × 1685 — about 9.5 MB whatever
 *   the hand does for however long — so one contact can never be the thing that overflows the
 *   48 MB history. (The Manta's 1860 × 2480 is ~18.4 MB, still one entry.)
 * - **The tiles are disjoint**, so they can be swapped back in any order and the replayer has no
 *   read order to remember.
 * - **A small mark stays small.** A hairline stroke touches one to four cells — 16 to 64 KB — which
 *   is hundreds of marks inside the budget.
 *
 * Sixty-four is the size at which both ends of that are true at once. Much larger and a dot in the
 * corner of a cell costs a quarter of a megabyte; much smaller and a page-wide sweep is tens of
 * thousands of separate reads and array allocations while the artist is rubbing.
 *
 * Everything here is pure arithmetic and `IntArray`s: the reading of actual pixels arrives as a
 * lambda from the screen, which is the only place that has a paper view to ask.

 * closed by the door itself, because a composited bake never produces a pen-up.
 *
 * The screen feeds it every rect g-paper reports and hands it a way to read pixels; it decides which
 * of those actually need reading (see [RasterTiles] — a cell is read once and never again) and hands
 * back a single [SketchEdit.RasterChanged] at the end, or nothing when there is nothing to take back.
 *
 * **A builder belongs to one raster**. [layer] is fixed at construction and stamped
 * on the entry, because a contact only ever changes one of the page's two images — g-paper's own
 * rule — and the tiles it reads are that image's, swapped back into that image and no other. The
 * screen opens a builder on the layer the engine names at the contact's first will-change; a
 * second layer arriving inside one contact would be the engine breaking its own rule, and the
 * screen closes the entry and opens a fresh one rather than mixing two images' pixels into a patch
 * list that carries no layer of its own.
 *
 * **The cap is a belt, and it is kept anyway.** With cells aligned to the page a single contact
 * cannot hold more than the page itself, which is well under the budget — so [tooBig] should never
 * happen. If it ever does, what happens is the honest thing rather than the clever one: the pixels
 * held are dropped, nothing is recorded, and the gesture does nothing for that one contact. An undo
 * that quietly half-restores a sweep would be worse than an undo that admits it cannot.
