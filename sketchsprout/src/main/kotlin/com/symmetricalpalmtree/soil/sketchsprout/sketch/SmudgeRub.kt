/**
 * The finger rub that smudges graphite (Notesprout SN's arc 48) — the recogniser, in pure Kotlin.
 *
 * A smudge is a **one-finger back-and-forth**: the hand rubs across a hatch in short, quick
 * strokes, the way a finger blends pencil on paper. What tells it from every other one-finger
 * gesture on the page is the **reversal** — a swipe travels one way and lifts; a tap and a
 * long-press do not travel at all — and what tells it from a swipe that happened to bounce is
 * **staying put**: at the moment of the reversal the finger is still within [armWithinPx] of
 * where it landed. So the rub arms on the first reversal of travel inside that reach, and
 * never on anything else.
 *
 * Travel is read in **hops**: each time the finger has moved [hopPx] from the last hop's end,
 * that hop's direction is compared with the previous hop's; a turn of more than 120°
 * ([REVERSAL_COS], the rubber's own number) is a reversal. Hops are short so a rapid rub of a
 * centimetre or two reverses within a sample or two of the hand actually turning.
 *
 * **Before it arms, the samples are kept**; on arming they are delivered as the first batch,
 * so the first stroke of the rub smudges too rather than being the price of recognition.
 * After it arms every move is a batch, and the lift ends it. A second finger ends an armed rub
 * (what was smudged stays) and kills an unarmed one; a sequence that was refused at the down
 * (a stylus, chrome, the pen gate) is ignored whole; [gate] is asked again at the reversal
 * and on every batch, so a pen that arrives mid-rub ends it — the pen-activity rule every
 * finger gesture on these screens keeps.
 *
 * Coordinates are the paper's; the caller converts. Nothing here touches Android.
