/**
 * The WebP header, read by hand (Notesprout SN's, arc 45) — the guard that stands in front of
 * every sketch decode.
 *
 * A page's raster is only meaningful at exactly the page's size: an image of the wrong dimensions
 * composited over the paper is a drawing sliding off its own page, and a *malformed* one is a
 * decoder handed bytes from who knows where. Both are cheap to rule out before any bitmap is
 * allocated — the answer is in the first 30 bytes — and expensive to discover afterwards, which is
 * why the screen checks [matches] before it hands stored bytes to a decoder, and the store
 * never has to.
 *
 * **Why WebP:** a sketch is three rasters — graphite, ink and marker — each stored as a page-sized
 * **lossless WebP with alpha** (RGBA, colour-ready for the platforms where the pen will have a
 * colour). A PNG is simply not a WebP and fails this guard; there is no legacy to sniff for.
 *
 * **What the container looks like.** `RIFF` · file size · `WEBP`, then the first chunk: a FourCC
 * and a little-endian size. libwebp writes a lossless image as either
 *  - **`VP8L`** — the simple lossless form: one signature byte `0x2F`, then 28 bits of 14-bit
 *    `width − 1` / `height − 1` (little-endian, the width in the low bits); or
 *  - **`VP8X`** — the extended form (used when the encoder adds a feature flag, metadata or, for a
 *    lossy image, a separate alpha chunk): a flags byte, 3 reserved bytes, then 24-bit
 *    `width − 1` / `height − 1`, each little-endian.
 * Either may head a lossless RGBA image depending on the encoder's mood, so both are read; a `VP8 `
 * (lossy) first chunk is refused — nothing on this seam writes one.
 *
 * **No Android classes here on purpose.** `BitmapFactory` could answer the size question with
 * `inJustDecodeBounds`, but that is a platform call that cannot run on the JVM, and this is the one
 * piece of the raster border whose every boundary deserves a laptop test: truncation at each field,
 * a wrong FourCC, a first chunk that is neither form. Little-endian by hand, bounds-checked at
 * every read, and a 0-length array answers null like anything else it cannot parse.
 *
 * It parses the header and nothing else: no RIFF size reconciliation against `bytes.size` (a
 * truncated body is the decoder's to report), and no opinion about the values it reads —
 * the page size is the caller's guard, not the parser's. A parser that refused a
 * legal file would be a worse bug than the one it was guarding against.
