/**
 * When the debounced save of a raster page fires — pure Kotlin, so the rule is pinned by a test
 * (Notesprout SN's, arc 50).
 *
 * The debounce alone was the whole cadence once: three seconds after the last change, then the
 * pen-idle gate. Every change restarts the three seconds and the gate waits for the pen to leave
 * hover range, so a hand that keeps sketching never reaches a save until it pauses and lifts away
 * — a hundred seconds of smudging went with a force-stop one day, and a crash would take the same.
 *
 * So a page has a **deadline**: from its first unsaved change it may stay unsaved [MAX_DIRTY_MS]
 * at most. The debounce wait is the shorter of its own three seconds and what is left to the
 * deadline ([debounceWait]); once the deadline has passed, the idle gate is bounded too —
 * [IDLE_LIMIT_MS] of waiting for the pen to go idle, then [LIFT_LIMIT_MS] for the next pen lift (a
 * copy between strokes, never inside one), and then the copy is taken regardless: a page-sized
 * memcpy on the main thread costs tens of milliseconds, and the encode runs off it.
