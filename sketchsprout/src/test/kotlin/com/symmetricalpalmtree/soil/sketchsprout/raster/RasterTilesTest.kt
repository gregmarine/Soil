/**
 * The arithmetic of a raster undo:
 * which squares of the page an entry has to remember, and how few times each of them is read.
 *
 * This is the half of the undo that can be proved with no tablet in the room, and it is the half
 * where a mistake would be silent. A cell read twice is invisible until a minute of scrubbing has
 * quietly filled the history; a cell not read at all is a square of the drawing that undo steps
 * over; a cell whose rect and pixel count disagree is refused by the engine with a log line nobody
 * is reading. None of the three looks like anything at the moment it happens.
 *
 * **What cannot be tested here**, and goes on the device walk instead: an edit made on one page and
 * taken back from another. That is `SketchActivity` — a page turn, the pen-idle gate,
 * and the swap into a live `PaperView` — and every part of it needs the panel. The rule it has to
 * prove is that the page is *not* reloaded after the swap: a reload would read the stored row, which
 * still holds the image as it was before the undo, and put it straight back.
