/**
 * The name a folder's naming scheme suggests for the next notebook created in it. One recipe, two callers — the library's +Notebook and the link picker's New
 * notebook — so a scheme can never mean one thing in the library and another in the picker.
 *
 * It owns only the *rules*; the index reads stay with the caller, which is what keeps this pure
 * enough to JVM-test and what lets the picker fetch siblings from its own browse folder.
 *
 * Two guards are the reason this is not a one-liner:
 *  - **The siblings are fetched lazily.** `{n}` is the only token that asks what is already in the
 *    folder, so a scheme without a counter must never pay for that read ([siblings] is invoked only
 *    when the parsed scheme holds one).
 *  - **A name the library would refuse is not a prefill.** An expansion that fails the family charset ([TemplateNames]) — or
 *    that outgrew [SchemeEngine.MAX_SCHEME_CHARS] because the counter passed its declared width —
 *    falls back to the caller's own default rather than being handed to a screen that will reject
 *    it. Naming never blocks what the user asked for.
