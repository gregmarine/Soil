/**
 * The pad's pages — in memory, over [ScratchStore] (arc 11 / J4, on rows since arc 22 / X2, over
 * `:ext-ink` since arc 23 / Y1). The screen owns the paper and the chrome; this owns *which* page is
 * showing, the page list and its structural edits, and the page's size; **what is on the page** —
 * the [TreeMap] of strokes, the op log, the re-flush rule and the four stroke-level replays — is
 * [InkDocument]'s, shared with the calendar so the two never drift.
 *
 * **The split of threads is deliberate.** Mutations ([addStroke], [erase], [move]) are synchronous
 * and run on Main, straight out of the g-paper callbacks: they touch only the in-memory page, so a
 * pen-up never waits on IO. Everything that reaches the store ([load], [goTo], [insert],
 * [deleteCurrent], [flushUntilClean], the replays) is `suspend` and hops to [Dispatchers.IO] for
 * the store call itself. The screen serialises the suspending half behind one mutex, exactly as the
 * notebook serialises its page ops.
 *
 * **The page size is the pad's one extra unwritten thing.** A page stored as `0 × 0` learns its
 * size at first layout and owes the row one `UPDATE`; it rides ahead of the strokes in the next
 * flush ([InkDocument.flushUntilClean]'s `extraDirty`), and comes back if that write fails.
 *
 * [goTo] reads the target page **first** and flushes the departing one **second**, so the swap
 * itself has no suspension point for a commit to fall into.
 *
 * **A received placement (J5) never lands here.** `ScratchStore.receive` writes it on the Binder
 * thread before the screen exists; the document simply [load]s what is already in the store. What
 * the screen does record is one undo entry, and the two arms it replays through are here.
