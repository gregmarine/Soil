/**
 * Recovery of an interrupted [RekeyCommit] (arc 26 / U2, D1 "recovery of an interrupted commit"),
 * as a pure decision over what each of the three names is right now, plus an executor over
 * [RekeyFs] that re-verifies before every delete. The **rule that binds every branch: nothing is
 * deleted unless the file that will survive verifies** under a key the caller trusts.
 *
 * What a name can be: [Presence.ABSENT]; [Presence.VERIFIES] — present and the caller's verifier
 * opened it; [Presence.UNVERIFIED] — present but no trusted key opens it (mid-rotation, that can be
 * a file already under the *other* key; the rotation resume passes a verifier that knows both).
 *
 * | original | tmp | bak | plan |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | VERIFIES | any | any | [Plan.DropLeftovers] — the swap finished (or never started); the leftovers are noise |
 * | UNVERIFIED | any | any | [Plan.Leave] — a present file no trusted key opens is never touched |
 * | ABSENT | VERIFIES | any | [Plan.RestoreTmp] — the death was between the two renames or the export's key is the trusted one; the tmp becomes the original, then the bak may go |
 * | ABSENT | other | VERIFIES | [Plan.RestoreBak] — the tmp is not trusted; the original comes back, then the tmp may go |
 * | ABSENT | other | other | [Plan.Leave] — two files, neither opens: keep both for a person to look at |
