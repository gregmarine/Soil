 * og's `commitReplace`, as a state machine over [RekeyFs] (arc 26 / U2, D1 step 3): swap an
 * **accepted** `X.rekey.tmp` into `X`'s place with the original never at risk —
 *
 *  1. fsync the tmp;
 *  2. refuse if the original has a **non-empty** `-wal` (live data the caller failed to absorb —
 *     a rename would orphan it), else delete its empty `-wal` / `-shm` so the new file does not
 *     inherit a stale shared-memory index;
 *  3. clear a stale `X.old.bak` (a leftover of an earlier run whose original has since been
 *     proven good by the export that just ran from it);
 *  4. rename `X` → `X.old.bak`;
 *  5. rename `X.rekey.tmp` → `X`; on failure rename the `.old.bak` straight back;
 *  6. fsync the directory, delete the `.old.bak`.
 *
 * Every exit is an [Outcome]; nothing throws. The two-rename window is what [RekeyRecovery] exists
 * for: a death between 4 and 5 leaves `X.old.bak` + `X.rekey.tmp` and no `X`, a death between 5
 * and 6 leaves `X` + `X.old.bak`, and both are recoverable without guessing because every file
 * involved can be verified against a key.
