/**
 * The rotation journal (arc 26 / U3, D2) — written to [PassphraseStore] **before any file is
 * touched** and rewritten after every file, so a death anywhere inside a rotation is resumable.
 *
 * Lives in EncryptedSharedPreferences beside the cached global passphrase (the same posture:
 * device-local, never synced, never in the index, never in an Intent). While one exists the
 * library is in two keys: files already re-keyed open under [newPassphrase], the rest under the
 * cached global. `SnIndex.ensureReady` tries [newPassphrase] for the index and commits the rotation
 * itself when it fits (resume path 3); Bootstrap forwards to the Encryption screen so the banner
 * cannot be missed (path 2); the banner's Resume is path 1.
 *
 * @property pendingIds what is still to re-key, in [RotationPlan] order — notebooks, then
 *   `ext:<pkg>` stores, then the index id last. Ids only, never names.
 * @property newPassphrase the passphrase every file ends up under. Never logged.
 * @property minted true when [newPassphrase] is an auto-minted `SOIL-` key — the commit then clears
 *   the recovery-key acknowledgement so Bootstrap shows it once through `RecoveryKeyActivity`.
 * @property total how many ids the rotation started with — the progress dialog's `t` after a resume.
 * @property notebookCount how many of those ids were notebooks — the completion dialog's count.
 * @property startedAt device epoch-ms when the rotation began. A resume re-lists the library: a
 *   `GLOBAL` notebook not in [pendingIds] whose row is newer than this (created or imported
 *   between a Cancel and the Resume — the library is reachable in between) was minted under the
 *   OLD key and joins the list, so nothing can be left behind under a key the commit forgets.
 * @property quarantined notebooks that opened under **neither** key and were moved to `NOTEBOOK`
 *   scope (D2's quarantine). Reported at the end; U6's recovery is the way back.
