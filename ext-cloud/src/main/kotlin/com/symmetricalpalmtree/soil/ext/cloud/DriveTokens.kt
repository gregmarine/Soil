 * benefit, and because *the extension writes nothing to disk itself, ever*.
 *
 * Freshness is [DriveAuth.isFresh] against the already-skewed expiry, so a call never starts on a

 *  - **granted** — cache it and carry on;
 *  - **revoked** (Google's `invalid_grant`: the person removed the app, the token expired after
 *    months unused, the consent was withdrawn) — the refresh token is dead, so it is **forgotten

 *    the store would make `status()` lie forever;
 *  - **failed** — anything else; nothing changed, so it reads as `network` and trying again is safe.
