/**
 * **What [CloudService] actually does, as a plain class** (arc 25 / V2).
 *
 * A `Binder.Stub` cannot be instantiated on the JVM, so a seam whose behaviour lives inside the stub
 * is a seam that can only be tested on a device. Everything above argument validation and fd
 * handling therefore lives here: the service checks its caller, validates, opens the streams, and
 * delegates. This class is the unit the JVM tests exercise over a fake store and a fake transport —
 * which is the whole gate this arc has, since there is no code review (`DRIVE_PLAN.md` decision 12).
 *
 * It touches no Android type beyond the two wire parcelables, and it never logs the account.
