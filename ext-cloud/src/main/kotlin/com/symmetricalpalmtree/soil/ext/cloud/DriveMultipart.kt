/**
 * Drive's `uploadType=multipart` body (arc 25 / V2) — metadata part, then bytes part, one request.
 *
 * **Why two upload shapes at all.** A multipart upload is one round trip and is what Drive itself
 * recommends up to about 5 MiB; above that a dropped connection costs the whole transfer, so a
 * resumable session is worth its extra round trip. [MULTIPART_MAX_BYTES] is that line, and
 * [useMultipart] is the only place it is read.
 *
 * The body is assembled as **prefix + the source's bytes + suffix**, never as one buffer: the source
 * is a `ParcelFileDescriptor` the host opened on a `.soil` that can be hundreds of megabytes, and
 * this process must never hold it. That is also why the length has to be computable up front
 * ([length]) — `setFixedLengthStreamingMode` needs it, and it is what lets a short read be a
 * refusal instead of a hang.
 *
 * `\r\n` is MIME's line ending and every one here is a Kotlin escape, never a raw control byte.
