/**
 * Stream exactly the number of bytes the host promised, and refuse anything else (arc 25 / V2).
 *
 * The seam's `upload` carries `expectedBytes` — what the host wrote into the fd it handed over —
 * and the whole point of it is that the provider can tell an interrupted export from a finished
 * one *before* the file lands in the user's Drive under a name that says it is complete. A short
 * source is the fd being closed early; a long one is the host and the provider disagreeing about
 * what was written. Either way the upload is refused rather than committed.
 *
 * The two messages are informative, not contractual: the host reads any message but the seam's two
 * verbatim refusals as "the provider didn't answer".
