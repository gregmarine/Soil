 * Every statement the Drive provider sends against its `account` table (arc 25 / V1), as pure
 * builders — SQL text and bound arguments and nothing else, so the shapes are JVM-testable without
 * a store.
 *
 * `account` has no children and no cascade to protect, so a plain `INSERT OR REPLACE` is safe here
 * — unlike the tag manager's tables, there is nothing a REPLACE's delete-then-insert could take
 * down with it.
