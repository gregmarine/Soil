/**
 * **Every refusal this provider can make, minted in one place** (arc 25 / V2). The seam allows only
 * three exception types across a stub, and the host compares exactly two messages **verbatim**
 * ([CloudContract.NOT_CONNECTED], [CloudContract.NETWORK]) — so the mapping table has to live
 * somewhere it can be read at a glance and tested without a network.
 *
 * The table:
 *
 * | what happened | what crosses |
 * |---|---|
 * | offline, DNS, TLS, a socket timeout, any `IOException` | `IllegalStateException("network")` |
 * | http 5xx, or 429 (rate limited) | `IllegalStateException("network")` |
 * | no refresh token in the store, or Google says the token is dead | `IllegalStateException("not connected")` |
 * | any other 4xx (400 / 403 / 404 on a specific call) | `IllegalStateException("http <code>")` |
 * | anything else at all (a serialization failure, an NPE) | `IllegalStateException("provider failure (<class>)")` |
 *
 * The last row is the one that matters most: a **non-marshalable** exception leaving a stub kills
 * the Binder transaction silently and the host waits out its whole timeout for nothing (the arc-2
 * trap). Everything is funnelled through [marshalable] on the way out.
 *
 * No message ever carries user content — no file name, no email, no URL, no token.
